This repository builds a Docker image with rstudio-server with CytoExploreR pre-
installed. My intention is to trial RStudio/CytoExploreR as a replacement for
commercial paid flow cytometry visualization softwares.

To build, run build.sh; to run, run run.sh. For customized builds and runs,
adapt the commands within these two shell scripts.

Requires Docker. Apptainer does not seem work, apparently due to some 
incompatibility between rstudio-server and Apptainer's read-only filesystem.
